# Completion Summary: Metadata Field Population

## Mission Accomplished ✓

Successfully populated `is_open_code` and `is_open_data` fields in all 25 metadata parquet files using data from rtrans_out.

## Results

### Processing Statistics
- **Total metadata files processed**: 25
- **Total rows processed**: 6,470,793
- **Total values populated**: 7,790,334
- **Processing time**: 8.8 minutes

### Field Population
- **is_open_code**: 3,895,167 values populated (60.2% of all rows)
- **is_open_data**: 3,895,167 values populated (60.2% of all rows)

### Match Rate
- Average match rate: ~60-85% depending on file
- Higher match rates in earlier PMC batches (80-85%)
- Lower match rates in later batches (25-55%)

## Output Location

**Populated metadata files**: `~/pmcoaXMLs/populated_metadata/`
- 25 parquet files (same structure as originals)
- Total size: 568 MB
- All original columns preserved
- Only `is_open_code` and `is_open_data` fields updated

## Sample Results (First 5 Files)

| File | Rows | is_open_code populated | is_open_data populated |
|------|------|----------------------|----------------------|
| oa_comm_PMC000 | 3,028 | 2,514 (83.0%) | 2,514 (83.0%) |
| oa_comm_PMC001 | 27,515 | 22,316 (81.1%) | 22,316 (81.1%) |
| oa_comm_PMC002 | 122,576 | 103,935 (84.8%) | 103,935 (84.8%) |
| oa_comm_PMC003 | 323,742 | 265,145 (81.9%) | 265,145 (81.9%) |
| oa_comm_PMC004 | 392,730 | 320,961 (81.7%) | 320,961 (81.7%) |

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Split rtrans file
- Input: 4,026,571 rows
- Output: 21 chunks (~200k rows each)
- Memory efficient: ~1 MB per chunk
- Time: 11.4 seconds

### Phase 2: Iterative population
- Processed each metadata file against all 21 rtrans chunks
- Memory efficient: Only 1 metadata file + 1 chunk in memory at a time
- Peak memory usage: < 200 MB
- No concatenation required

## Files Created

### Scripts
- `split_rtrans.py` - Splits rtrans into manageable chunks
- `populate_metadata_iterative.py` - Populates fields iteratively
- `merge_parquet_files.py` - Original approach (not used due to memory constraints)

### Documentation
- `POPULATION_STRATEGY.md` - Detailed strategy document
- `USAGE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Step-by-step usage guide
- `COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Intermediate Files
- `~/pmcoaXMLs/rtrans_out_chunks/` - 21 chunk files (can be deleted if desired)

### Output
- `~/pmcoaXMLs/populated_metadata/` - 25 populated parquet files ✓

## Verification

All files verified with correct population:
- Original structure preserved (122 columns)
- Only targeted fields updated
- No data loss
- File sizes appropriate (~568 MB total)

## Next Steps

The populated metadata files are ready for further analysis:
1. Use files from `~/pmcoaXMLs/populated_metadata/`
2. Original files remain unchanged in `~/pmcoaXMLs/extracted_metadata_parquet/`
3. Optional: Delete `~/pmcoaXMLs/rtrans_out_chunks/` to save space (22 MB)

## Performance Notes

This approach successfully avoided memory issues by:
- Processing files iteratively (not concatenating)
- Using small chunks from rtrans (1 MB each)
- Processing one metadata file at a time
- Efficient joins using pandas merge

Total memory usage stayed well under 500 MB throughout the process, making it viable even on systems with limited RAM.
